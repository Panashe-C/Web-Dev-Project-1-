Hey, i am going to stop here for now, However here is something i want us to work on improving once the frontend looks decent.

1. The Hover over game/ special ganme that plays the trailer of the game without comprimising, any of the code.

2. The Shop, Oooh the shop, it should be a multi functional shop that actually functions. 

I wanted to make the switch smaller but it is alright as it is, so it stands out
